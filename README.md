## Project VR: A Virtual Reality game for chronic pain management
The game doesn't have a name, as it was a project for term paper.

#### Term Paper Summary: 
*Virtual Reality (VR) is a form of immersive technology that has shown increasing potential in the therapeutic treatment of patients suffering from acute and/or chronic pain conditions. However, VR interventions generally use games and/or applications that are not adapted for the treatment and that depend on expensive devices for the majority of the population. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop a VR game for chronic pain management, for use on smartphones, focusing on **cognitive engagement** and **mindfulness meditation**. The game was evaluated by a professional physical therapist to identify his perception of the game as a tool to support physical therapy. The results showed that the game can provide an immersive, distracting and relaxing experience in an eventual treatment. We conclude that the game through VR can be useful as a tool for chronic pain management, but further evaluations and studies need to be conducted, especially when related to chronic pain management.*
